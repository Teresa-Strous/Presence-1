# Samuel Killermann Curriculum Vitae
Welcome! This is the repo for my 2018 rebuild of my CV site. It's open-source, all of my contributions to the repo are uncopyrighted, and you're welcome to copy this, customize it, and deploy it for your own CV (or whatever you dream up).

I built this as an experiment on a few fronts:

1. **Learning new technologies/frameworks:** in this case, that's [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), [Netlify](http://netlify.com), and the [JAMstack Methedology](https://jamstack.org/).
2. **Simplifying updates and adding new work samples.** My old site was a custom Wordpress theme, but even that was more cumbersome than helpful at times, and prevented me from updating the site.
3. **Zero cost overhead, without compromising on server quality or traffic.** Mostly inspired by my [hilariously-expensive hosting costs for my main site](https://www.patreon.com/posts/i-migrated-ipms-16260203), I really wanted to not have to pay hundreds of dollars a month to host my CV.

If there's interest, I'll write a tutorial for people who want to build a site based on mine (from soup to nuts). For now, I'll just trust that folks can poke around the Hugo and Netlify documentation, and figure things out from there.
